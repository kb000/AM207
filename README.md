Class final project

# Abstract
TODO

## Where is your data coming from?
Hubway released data: [http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/], and NOAA publishes data on-demand: [https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/]

## Which methods from class are you planning to use?
To test our ridership model hypotheses, we will use Hierarchical Bayesian model fitting with Expectation Maximization of our mixture models.  Inference of missing weather data will use spatial and time series models.

## Any other general comments or questions?
The ridership data seems like it may merit further analysis as a time series, but our expertise is insufficient to examine the possibilities.
