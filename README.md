Class final project

# Abstract
The Hubway Bicycle share system serves riders in the urban core and near suburbs of Boston.  We'd like to discover something about the riders who use the system.  In 2013, the service providers released a dataset which we will analyze with respect to historical weather data, in order to explore the validity of different modeling hypotheses.  In brief, we believe that ridership may be composed of different constituencies, commuters and joyriders, which are affected differently by varying weather conditions.

## Where is your data coming from?
Hubway released data: [http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/], and NOAA publishes data on-demand: [https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/]

## Which methods from class are you planning to use?
To test our ridership model hypotheses, we will use Hierarchical Bayesian model fitting with Expectation Maximization of our mixture models.  Inference of missing weather data will use spatial and time series models.

## Any other general comments or questions?
The ridership data seems like it may merit further analysis as a time series, but our expertise is insufficient to examine the possibilities.
